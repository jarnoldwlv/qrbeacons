A guide to use of Quick Response (QR) Codes to allow low click, low latency access to audio-based content, or supplemental information regarding existing works.

This has been created as part of (7MU007) Musical Human-Computer Interaction for the MSc in Audio Technology at the University of Wolverhampton.

SIMPLIFIED PROCESS
1) Create Content
2) Host Content Online
3) Get Shareable URL
4) Use URL to generate QR Code via specialist website.

For this iteration of the the project, I've used private SoundCloud albums to host tracks; and QRstuff.com to generate the codes.

I've included the PowerPoint file, and digital copies of the examples used on 17/05/18 in the presentation element of the module.

Examples used were:
- An Audio Flyer for a production of Mind the Gap's "Mia: Daughters of Fortune" at the Arena Theatre.
- Artist Biographies for Marie Sewell and Neil Hodgkiss who created #25 "Fenrir" as part of the Wolves in Wolves Art Trail in 2017, currently housed at the Arena Theatre.
- A "Cliched Video Game-style Audio Log" and the accompanying artwork for an Audio-based art trial project.
- The Live Demonstration, where I recorded my introduction, and went through the process in real time.
