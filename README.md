# qrbeacons
A guide to use of Quick Response (QR) Codes to allow low click, low latency access to audio-based content, or supplemental information regarding existing works.

This has been created as part of (7MU007) Musical Human-Computer Interaction for the MSc in Audio Technology at the University of Wolverhampton.

SIMPLIFIED PROCESS
1) Create Content
2) Host Content Online
3) Get Shareable URL
4) Use URL to generate QR Code via specialist website.

For this iteration of the the project, I've used private [SoundCloud albums](https://soundcloud.com/user-374109182/sets/qr-code-resources) to host tracks; and [QRstuff.com](https://www.qrstuff.com/) to generate the codes.

I've included the PowerPoint file, and digital copies of the examples used on 17/05/18 in the presentation element of the module.

Examples used were:
- An Audio Flyer for a production of Mind the Gap's "Mia: Daughters of Fortune" at the Arena Theatre.
